| Creating your .xlsx file |
============================
The following prerequisites must be met by any .xlsx file used by this program:
- The file must have one column filled exclusively with E-mails. (These can be any email address.)
- The file must have one column filled with names of the recipiants.
- The file must have one column filled with the gender of the recipiants. Should you wish to not provide a gender, please assign a random, empty column.

The program automatically assumes that:
-the addresses are in column A
-the names are in column B
-the genders are in column D

Should this not be the case, please change the values in mailWriterSettings.py.

You may optionally define a company name in column C or any column you choose.
